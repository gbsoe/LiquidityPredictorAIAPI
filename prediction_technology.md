# SolPool Insight: Prediction Technology

## Our Prediction Technology: The Science Behind Our Insights

SolPool Insight leverages advanced data science, machine learning, and blockchain analytics to provide accurate predictions about Solana liquidity pool performance. This document outlines our prediction methodology, data collection process, and the technology stack that powers our analytics engine.

## Data Collection Infrastructure

### Continuous and Comprehensive Data Collection

Our predictions are built on a foundation of comprehensive historical data collected through our automated data pipeline:

- **Collection Frequency**: Hourly snapshots of pool metrics (APR, liquidity, volume)
- **Token Price Updates**: Every 30 minutes via CoinGecko API
- **Data Points Per Pool**: Hundreds of time-series data points across multiple metrics
- **Pool Coverage**: Up to 100 most relevant pools across major Solana DEXes (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, Saber)
- **Storage**: Full historical data in PostgreSQL database with time-series optimization

### Pool Selection Methodology

Pools are selected using a multi-tier prioritization approach:

1. **Major DEX Coverage**: Prioritizing established DEXes (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, Saber)
2. **Liquidity Threshold**: Focus on pools with substantial liquidity
3. **Trading Activity**: Pools with consistent trading volume
4. **Token Diversity**: Representation across different token categories
5. **User Interest**: Pools with high user engagement

## Prediction Models & Methodology

### Machine Learning Model Architecture

Our prediction system employs multiple specialized models:

1. **APR Prediction Model**
   - Architecture: Random Forest Regressor / XGBoost
   - Function: Predicts future APR changes based on historical patterns
   - Features: Time-series metrics, price ratio volatility, blockchain metrics

2. **Pool Performance Classifier**
   - Architecture: Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - Function: Categorizes pools into performance classes (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)
   - Metrics: Consistency, stability, risk-adjusted returns

3. **Risk Assessment Model**
   - Architecture: Custom ensemble model
   - Function: Quantifies risk factors and provides a comprehensive risk score
   - Factors: Volatility, impermanent loss risk, smart contract risk

### Feature Engineering

Our models analyze over 40 engineered features, including:

- **Time-Based Features**: Day of week, hour patterns, seasonal effects
- **Rolling Metrics**: Moving averages, volatility measures, momentum indicators
- **Price-Based Features**: Token price ratios, correlation metrics, price volatility
- **On-Chain Metrics**: Blockchain congestion, network activity, transaction costs
- **Blockchain-Specific Factors**: Solana validator metrics, program deployments

### Training Methodology

1. **Daily Model Training**: Models are retrained daily at 1:00 AM UTC
2. **Historical Context**: Training on complete historical dataset
3. **Validation**: Rigorous cross-validation with time-series split
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automated tuning for optimal performance
5. **Reinforcement Learning Components**: Optimization of model weights based on prediction accuracy

## Validation & Accuracy

### Quality Assurance

1. **Backtesting**: Models are backtested against historical data
2. **Prediction History**: All predictions are stored and validated against actual outcomes
3. **Continuous Validation**: Daily validation against real-world performance

### Accuracy Metrics

Our prediction models regularly achieve:
- **APR Prediction**: Mean absolute error below 2.5% for 7-day predictions
- **Performance Classification**: F1-score of 0.82+
- **Risk Assessment**: 85%+ correlation with actual volatility
